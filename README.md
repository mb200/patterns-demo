# Demos

This was adapted from Kent C. Dodds' Advanced React Patterns (v2) workshop for [Frontend Masters](https://www.frontendmasters.com). Check out
his [original repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/advanced-react-patterns-v2).

## Try it out

First, install the dependencies. From the root directory, run:

```
yarn
```

Then, run:

```
yarn start
```

To switch demos, simply comment out an import and uncomment another in `src/App.tsx`. Save the changes and it will hot reload with the new demo.

```tsx
// import { Demo } from './demos/1';
import { Demo } from './demos/2'; // I uncommented this to view Demo 2.
```
